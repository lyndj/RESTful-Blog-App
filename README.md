# RESTful-Blog-App

This was an exercise from Colt Steel's WebDev Bootcamp to practise the concept of RESTful Routing.

Front-End Technologies: HTML, CSS & Semantic UI
Back-End & Data Server Technologies: NodeJS, Express, MongoDB

- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application utilising all 7 RESTful routes (INDEX, NEW, CREATE, SHOW, EDIT, UPDATE, DESTROY) 
- Utilised package method-override to enable PUT & DELETE requests which are not supported by HTML forms. 
- Utilised package express-sanitizer (an express middleware)to strip out script tags. 
- The interface is built using Semantic UI, giving a clean and light feel compared to Bootstrap that tends to be a little clunky.
